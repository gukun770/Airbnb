# Airbnb
capstone project

### General Idea:

If someone's room/apartment/house suddenly becomes available, he want to know what he can do with this property. This project helps him to figure out if it is more profitable to rent apart/house/room for short time by using airbnb service or just lease the property out for long time. By doing that I try to predict the occupancy rate per month of an active airbnb host, then I can annualize such revenue and compare it with the long term rent revenue for the same address.
