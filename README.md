capstone project

### General Idea:

Someone has a vacant room/apartment/house, he wants to know how to make the most of this property. This project helps him to figure out whether it is more profitable to use airbnb short-term rentals service or lease the property out for long term. To compare these two options, I need to predict the occupancy rate per month of an active airbnb host, then I compare the profitability between the long-term and short-term rental revenue for the same address as well as the break-even occupancy rate.
