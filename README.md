# Airbnb
capstone project

### General Idea:

Someone has a vacant room/apartment/house, he wants to know how to make the most of this property. This project aims to help him figure out whether it is more profitable to use airbnb short-term rental service or lease the property out for long term. To compare these two options, I need to predict the occupancy rate per month of an active airbnb host, then I compare the profitability between the long-term and short-term rental revenue for the same address. In addition, I compute the break-even occupancy rate assuming the profitability is the same.
